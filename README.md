# MeshCore SAR

Flutter app for Search and Rescue operations over a [MeshCore](https://github.com/meshcore-dev) mesh radio network via Bluetooth Low Energy.

## Features

- **Messaging** — send/receive messages to contacts and channels
- **Contacts** — track team members, repeaters, and rooms with live telemetry
- **SAR Markers** — drop emoji-coded location pins (person found, fire, staging area) via chat messages
- **Map** — view team positions and markers on OpenStreetMap / topo / satellite; tiles cached for offline use
- **Location tracking** — periodic GPS updates broadcast to the mesh
- **Packet log** — inspect raw BLE frames for debugging

## BLE Protocol

MeshCore SAR is powered by the `meshcore_client` package:
**[github.com/dz0ny/meshcore_client](https://github.com/dz0ny/meshcore_client)**

The client handles BLE connection management, command queueing, and binary frame parsing/building, and is extracted so you can build custom tools, integrations, and apps on top of MeshCore.

## Requirements

- Flutter 3.19+ / Dart 3.3+
- Physical device with Bluetooth (BLE does not work on simulators)
- iOS 13+ or Android SDK 21+

## Build

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run                        # debug
flutter build apk --release        # Android
flutter build ios --release        # iOS
```

## GitHub Actions artifacts

Every push runs the `Build And Upload Release Assets` workflow and uploads build artifacts for:

- Android (`.apk`)
- Linux (`.tar.gz`)
- macOS (`.dmg`)
- Windows (`.zip`)

How to download them:

1. Open the repository on GitHub.
2. Go to **Actions**.
3. Open a workflow run named `Build And Upload Release Assets`.
4. In the run summary, scroll to **Artifacts**.
5. Download the artifact you need (`release-android`, `release-linux`, `release-macos`, `release-windows`).

For published releases, the same files are also attached to the GitHub Release page.

### iOS signing

```bash
open ios/Runner.xcworkspace
# Select team in Signing & Capabilities, then run from Xcode
```

### Clean rebuild

```bash
flutter clean && flutter pub get
cd ios && pod deintegrate && pod install && cd ..
```

## Permissions
